## Hi I'm Mica 

I am a fourth year undergraduate at UCSD studying pure math. In my free time I enjoy weightlifting, knitting, reading, watching movies, and going to art museums. My favorite movie is Fury dir. David Ayer, my favorite book is Martyr! by Kaveh Akbar, and my favorite painter is Caravaggio.

You can contact me at myl010 at ucsd dot edu.

## Research Interests 

I am broadly interested in geometry and algebra. In particular, I am interested in differential geometry, low-dimensional topology, and symplectic geometry. 

## Publications 

[1] Closest Point Exterior Calculus. Mica Li, Michael Owens, Juheng Wu, Grace Yang, Albert Chern. SIGGRAPH Asia Posters, 2023.
